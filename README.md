# I Am Rich

This project was inspired by the infamous "I Am Rich" application released in 2008 by Armin Heinrich (primarily as a joke). In short, the app would be sold for the highest possible price the App Store would allow (\$999.99) to fit one of the two following scenarios:

1. To prove to others you had a lot of money and bought an app that cost \$1000 and does nothing

2. To make the publisher (Admin Heinrich), _rich_.

## Story

This is my first Flutter project; I made this to get my feet wet with Flutter and Dart programming and experiment in the world of mobile development.
